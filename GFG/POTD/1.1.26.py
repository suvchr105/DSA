# Intersection in Y Shaped Lists
# Difficulty: Medium

# You are given the heads of two non-empty singly linked lists, head1 and head2, that intersect at a certain point. Return that Node where these two linked lists intersect.
# Note: It is guaranteed that the intersected node always exists.

"""
In the custom input you have to give input for CommonList which pointed at the end of both head1 and head2 to form a Y-shaped linked list.
Examples:

Input: head1: 10 -> 15 -> 30, head2: 3 -> 6 -> 9 -> 15 -> 30
Output: 15
Explanation: From the above image, it is clearly seen that the common part is 15 -> 30, whose starting point is 15.
    
Input: head1: 4 -> 1 -> 8 -> 5, head2: 5 -> 6 -> 1 -> 8 -> 5
Output: 1
Explanation: From the above image, it is clearly seen that the common part is 1 -> 8 -> 5, whose starting point is 1.
    
Constraints:
2 ≤ total number of nodes ≤ 2*105
-104 ≤ node->data ≤ 104
